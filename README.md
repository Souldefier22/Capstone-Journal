  Looking through a reported transaction as a basis for tracing the money
  Look at Wormhole incident report
    3 million stolen from wormhole on Solana
  Possibly start tracing when the money has been stolen but hasn't been moved yet
  Start looking at first transaction where they stole money
  Solscan and Solana beach can be helpful tools for tracing
  
  Stretch Goal - add the ability to blacklist wallet addresses
    when an address has been reported 3 times, add it to blacklist address
    find first transaction on address and then go forward from there
    
  Transactions cannot be deleted from blockchain
  Possibly give partial information until they select they would like to see more
  Heroku for web-hosting

  Understanding of how to do a trace from the origin point
  Should go backwards and forwards when given the bad transaction
  Sectioned up the project proposal
